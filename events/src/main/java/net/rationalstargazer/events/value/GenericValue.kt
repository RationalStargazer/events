/**
 * Represents `relaxed` (or `lazy`) value source which is a source that notifies about its changes only when it sees it is appropriate.
 * Not every change of `value` will trigger a notification of listeners.
 *
 * Relaxed (lazy) value sources are often sources that represent continuous values that change smoothly over time
 * and notify only about some important changes of their state according to their inner logic.
 *
 * For example `val timerSeconds: RStaGenericValue<Float, Boolean>` can represent the timer.
 * In such example `timerSeconds` can notify its listeners when it was started (`eventData == true`) or stopped (`eventData == false`).
 *
 * Another example is a value that reflects some complicated parameter that you want to be evaluated lazily.
 *
 * For example `val squareOfVeryComplexFigure: RStaValueSource<Double>` can use resource-consuming formula.
 * Instead of having to calculate the `value` every time the underlying figure has changed its shape
 * (possibly dozen of times per second in the case of animation)
 * it only have to calculate the `value` on demand when it is really needed (for example one time per second).
 *
 * `squareOfVeryComplexFigure` can notify its listeners from time to time that the value was somehow changed.
 * It doesn't need to really calculate the value to notify.
 * Often such sources pass `Unit` as `eventData` parameter.

/**
 * Represents a `Value` that can be changed over time.
 *
 * Standard implementations are:
 *
 * [RStaValueDispatcher] - mutable value
 *
 * [RStaDynamicValue] - value which is computed at every reading
 *
 * [RStaValueGenericConsumer] - like `RStaValueDispatcher`, more flexible, the best in a handler role
 *
 * [RStaValueMapper] - value that is a map of (a result of a calculation upon) another value
 *
 * [RStaChainGenericItem] - like `RStaValueMapper`, more flexible
 *
 * `Value` type parameter indicates a type of [value].
 * `Event` type parameter indicates a type of change event.
 * See [RStaValue] and [RStaValueSource] about `strict` and `relaxed` (lazy) value sources.
 *
 * `net.rationalstargazer.events` package promotes the concept of "pulling data" (not "pushing data").
 *
 * Concept of "push data" has a lot of advantages, especially when the process is asynchronous in its nature.
 * At the same time "push data" means different parts of an application works with values that represent states of the past,
 * and it can be that for different handlers they are different values from different past times.
 * Interacting with each other the handlers can produce inconsistent state.
 *
 * To explain it in more details let us examine the work of common producer-consumer pattern
 * Imagine that we have `Producer<State>` and few `Consumer<State>` working on a single thread.
 * When `Producer` pushes next `state` to its consumers it starts from the first `Consumer`, then the next one, then next, and so on...
 * It means that there is a point in time when from the first Consumer's point of view the state is different than for the second one.
 * Now let's imagine that each consumer is also a producer,
 * first Consumer produces StateA, and the second one produces StateB which conceptually are different aspects of a State.
 * These StateA and StateB then handled as a single pair (`Pair<StateA, StateB>`) somewhere later.
 * In a straightforward implementation it can lead to a situation when value of `Pair` is actually inconsistent
 * because value of StateA and value of StateB were originated from different states.
 *
 * Now let's examine a different implementation using the concept of "pulling data".
 *
 * The basic idea is that sources of data will generate events to notify their listeners about changes,
 * but it will be the listeners who will get data from sources.
 *
 * Let's illustrate it with [RStaValueSource]<State>.
 *
 * ```
 *     val stateSource: RStaValueSource<State> = injectStateSource()
 * ```
 *
 * We also want to have two intermediate handlers which handle incoming `State` and produce `StateA` and `StateB` respectively.
 *
 * In our implementation they will be represented by instances of [RStaDynamicValue] type
 * (not because it is the best way to implement it in a real application but because `RStaDynamicValue` is the most fundamental implementation of [RStaValueSource] which helps to illustrate basic concepts).
 * To keep the example simple we will not instantiate `RStaDynamicValue` directly but imagine that we have `createExampleDynamicValue` method.
 * The advantage of the imaginary method is that it only requires to provide a [value] getter for the future instance
 * (in reality `RStaDynamicValue` also requires to provide` the implementation of [checkValue]).
 *
 * ```
 *     val stateASource: RStaDynamicValue<StateA> = createExampleDynamicValue<StateA>(
 *         // provide getter for stateASource.value
 *         valueGetter = {
 *             // imagine we handled stateSource.value and returned something smart here
 *             StateA(stateSource.value)
 *         }
 *     )
 *
 *     // now stateASource can provide actual value every time but it also should notify its listeners about changes
 *     // to do this we listen changes of stateSource.value and propagate change event to our listeners
 *     stateSource.listen(RStaValueEventSource.Invoke.No, lifecycle) {
 *         stateASource.notify(Unit)  // will call listeners of stateASource
 *     }
 *
 *     // the same for stateBSource
 *     val stateBSource: RStaValue<StateB>
 * ```
 *
 * Finally we also want to have the final element which maps both StateA and StateB to a single `StateAB`.
 *
 * ```
 *     val stateABSource: RStaDynamicValue<StateAB> = createExampleDynamicValue(
 *         // getter for stateABSource.value
 *         valueGetter = {
 *             // imagine we handled stateASource.value and stateBSource.value and returned something smart here
 *             StateAB(stateASource.value, stateBSource.value)
 *         }
 *     )
 *
 *     // to notify listeners of stateABSource about changes we will listen our sources and propagate change events to our listeners
 *     // 1.
 *     stateASource.listen(RStaValueEventSource.Invoke.No, lifecycle) {
 *         stateABSource.notify(Unit) // will call listeners of stateABSource
 *     }
 *     // 2.
 *     stateBSource.listen(RStaValueEventSource.Invoke.No, lifecycle) {
 *         stateABSource.notify(Unit) // will call listeners of stateABSource
 *     }
 * ```
 *
 * Let's highlight main points.
 *
 * An event change is not used to propagate a data.
 * Instead it is used to just notify listeners about changes.
 * A data itself is obtained and calculated not at the time of the creation of event but at the time when a listener is reading it from the source.
 * To calculate `stateABSource.value` we use direct calls to `stateASource.value` and `stateBSource.value`.
 * They in turn use direct calls to `stateSource.value`.
 
 * So events are pushed to listeners, data is pulled from a source.
 * This way we always have consistent values every time regardless of pipelines' complexities and interdependencies between them.
 *
 * Note that as we always use direct function calls to get data and we work inside a single thread
 * we can use any references we want to get all we need
 * (as opposed to producer-consumer pattern where all data are somehow pushed to a pipeline).
